The dynamics of acid-base state (ABS) of circulating blood in the artery and in the cavernous sinus (CS) was studied in 3 groups consisting of 391 patients with cardiac pathology in the postoperative period in the operating room and in the cardio-resuscitation Department at 6 points. The ABS system consisting of 21 biochemical parameters was considered. The parameters are given in Table A. The results of dynamics simulation in CS are discussed in article. In the present study, the task was to build similar models for ABS dynamics in the artery and compare it with ABS dynamics in CS by the following methods.
