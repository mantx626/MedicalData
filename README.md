# MedicalData
The dynamics of acid-base state (ABS) of circulating blood in the artery and in the cavernous sinus (CS) was studied in 3 groups consisting of 391 patients with cardiac pathology in the postoperative period in the operating room and in the cardio-resuscitation Department at 6 points. The ABS system consisting of 21 biochemical parameters was considered. The parameters are given in Table A. The results of dynamics simulation in CS are discussed in article. In the present study, the task was to build similar models for ABS dynamics in the artery and compare it with ABS dynamics in CS by the following methods.
Parameters of ABS
Parameter name	Description of the parameter	Parameter name	Description of the parameter
рН	Acidity	Ca++	Calcium ion concentration
рО2	Oxygen partial pressure	Cl-	Chlorine Ion concentration
рСО2	Carbon dioxide partial pressure	Glu	Glucose concentration
АВЕ	Excess base	Lac	Lactate content
SBE	Lack of reason	p50	Hemoglobin affinity for oxygen
cHCO3	Plasma bicarbonate	mOsm	Blood osmolarity
cHCO3-st	Bicarbonate (alkali)	pH(T)	Acidity corrected for temperature
sO2	Oxygen boost	pO2(T)	Partial oxygen pressure adjusted for temperature
ctHb	Reference hemoglobin level	pCO2(T)	Carbon dioxide partial pressure adjusted for temperature
K+	Potassium ion concentration	Na+	Sodium ion concentration
Htc	Hematocrit
